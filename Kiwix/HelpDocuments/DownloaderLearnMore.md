> Q: Will background download consume my battery life?

A: Yes, but we try our best to minimize the impact. When Kiwix is minimized by pressing the home button. The app will be suspended or terminated just like any other app. The download task is handed off to a system agent, who will try to assess the situation and schedule task for best performance. (e.g. If battery is low, the download is likely to be deferred till a power resource is available)

A: No. All download will use WiFi only.

> Q: My WiFi connection is about to disconnect, do I need to pause all tasks?

> Q: What happens when I force quit Kiwix?

A: All outstanding download tasks will be paused, but they can be resumed.
