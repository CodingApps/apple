## How to Import
Add books or index folder through iTunes File Sharing. They will show up here automatically.

## Indicators
* <img src="Pic_I.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 12px;"/> indicates book has pictures
* <img src="Pic_P.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 12px;"/> indicates kiwix can find a idx folder associated with the book

## Naming Rules of Index Folder
* To add index, rename the idx folder to zim file name + .idx. For example, if the zim file is xyz.zim or xyz.zimaa, xyz.zimab, etc., name the idx folder xyz.zim.idx
* You may have to restart the app for Kiwix to recognize the idx folder. (for now)
