## About picture and index
* <img src="/Users/chrisli/Desktop/P.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 12px;"/> indicates book has pictures
* <img src="/Users/chrisli/Desktop/I.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 12px;"/> indicates kiwix can find a idx folder associated with the book
	* To add index, rename the idx folder to zim file name + .idx. For example, if the zim file is xyz.zim or xyz.zimaa, xyz.zimab, etc., name the idx folder xyz.zim.idx
	* You may have to restart the app for Kiwix to recognize the idx folder
